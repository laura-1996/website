        <h2>Hello.</h2>
        <p>I'm a 24 years old student from Cagliari, Sardinia and I've created this website in order to be chosen for an Internship.
        I'm really determined to get my place in a nice and innovative company because I love coding and I want it to become my career.
        My passions and hobbies are photography, travel and languages (I can actually speak four languages).
        I'm also a young mother, that means that I'm even more committed in changing my job.
        I studied at an Art High School in Padua and then I moved back to my origin region to study Economics at the University of Cagliari. By the way the university experience didn't fit for me so I quit.
        While working I tried a Web Design course in Cagliari but it didn't reflect my expectations. I learned more on Udemy about Web Design and Web Development.
        I attended the CodeMaster bootcamp at Talent Garden Innovation School where I learned about React and Javascript frameworks.
        I hope you enjoy this webpage.</p>

          <h3>Where do I see myself in three years?</h3>
          <p>In three years I imagine myself working for a big company with a nice development team to collaborate with. I also see me and my family living in a big city like Milan or Amsterdam.
             I would probably be much better in thinking like a developer and my skills would be improved as well.
